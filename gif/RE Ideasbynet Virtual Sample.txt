Hi Peter

Thank you for your email.  I hope you are well?

Its great that you are looking to go ahead and order.  We would prefer the
colour to be specified as a pantone - please find attached the weblink to
our pantone chart http://www.ideasbynet.com/pantone.htm so that you can find
the colour you require.

The other colour available in the Atlantic mug is black, you would need to
add an extra £0.12 nett onto the price of each mug to cover this and you
would have to be careful which colour you choose to print in - as many of
them would be translucent, I would suggest sticking to white if possible.
If you do require any other special colours then I would have to get a
special costing from our production department.

Let me know if you need any further information.

Kind regards

Julie

Hey Julie.

Thanks again for the confirmation of the available print area.  We worked
through the final details of the logo and should be in a position to send it
to you later today.   We have pretty much decided that it should be a single
colour print -- more for simplicity of design than cost to be honest -- so
additional quotations should not be needed.   We think that a single print
will be what's required.

If we wanted the single colour print to be a specific colour, how would you
like that specified?? I could use RGB, CMYK or even a Pantone reference
alongside the single colour (black on white) EPS image, or just send an
example and get you to match it??

We were also looking at the possibility of changing the colour of the mug --
is there a cost involved in not using white, and what colours do you have
available as standard??

We are looking at a quantity of 200-250 mugs -- final numbers are being
discussed today.

I'll await further confirmation on the above points before forwarding the
image and any colour and auantity specifications.

Thanks,

	Peter.
