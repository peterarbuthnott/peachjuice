Hi Peter

Thank you for your email.  The maximum print area is 185mm x 70mm, so if you
can work within this area then that will be fine, are you wanting to print
on both sides of the mug?  If you can save the file in either Illustrator,
Freehand, Photoshop or Quark and saved as an editable eps file then that
would be great.  Would you like me to do a price based on a two colour
print, if so please let me know the quantity and I'll prepare a quote no
problem for you.

Kind regards
